# Hotel Reviews Data Analysis
Data set: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews)

### Purpose
- Perform data analysis on a public data set using data frames
- Create different data visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib
- Clean and sort through unstructured data (reviews) 

### Questions
This project analyzes hotel reviews to answer the following questions:
1. What is the distribution of reviews based off of the rating given?
2. For each rating, what are the 10 most common phrases used in reviews?
3. How does the length of review for each rating differ?
4. What are the most common words used?

### Conclusions
Summary of correlations made from the project for the above questions:
1. The reviews in this data set are favored towards higher ratings. The order from highest to lowest number of reviews for each rating is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
2. By finding the 10 most common phrases for each rating group, we can figure out what people look for in "good" or "bad" hotels. Finding these common phrases lets us know what stands out to people when they stay in hotels and write reviews about their stay.
3. From looking at the graph, the average length of reviews for each rating is very similar. The differences can be observed more clearly by looking at the mean and mode of each rating. This shows that the higher the review is rated, the shorter the length of the review.
